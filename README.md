This site is maintained by [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com), who lives in the US. Sadly, mini rack gear is often only available in specific regions. For example, [many vendors sell only in the UK or parts of Europe](https://www.reddit.com/r/minilab/comments/1g1nto6/offtheshelf_10_gear_guide/). So this site is mainly focused on gear _I'm_ able to acquire, living in the US. That doesn't mean its scope can't broaden over time, though.

### <a name="racks"></a>10" Mini Racks

At the center of every mini rack is a 10" or 'half-width' rack. A typical rack is 19" wide, but half-racks fit in more places. There are only a few manufacturers of mini racks, currently, and availability varies by country.

### <a name="pdus"></a>PDUs (Power Distribution Units)

Every device in a rack needs power. If it's not provided by a PoE switch, it has to come from somewhere! A PDU, or Power Distribution Unit, takes one power source (usually AC wall power) and lets you plug multiple devices into it—whether through DC 12V adapters, USB-C, or AC outlets.

Some PDUs can be remotely managed, other PDUs are basically rack-mountable surge protectors. And yet others distribute power with more _panache_.

  - [GeeekPi DC PDU Lite - 7 Channel 12V 0.5U PDU](https://amzn.to/3DliKGG)

  - [NETIO PowerPDU 4KB 4 outlet](https://www.netio-products.com/en/device/powerpdu-4kb)

> **Note**: Some small PoE switches also have PoE+ or PoE++ power input, such as the [Ubiquiti USW-Ultra](https://store.ui.com/us/en/category/switching-utility/collections/pro-ultra/products/usw-ultra). Assuming you are in a location with another PoE++ switch, and everything is PoE-powered, you could power everything off one Ethernet cable, and bypass the need for a PDU or UPS in the mini rack!

### <a name="upses"></a>UPSes (Uninterruptible Power Supplies)

UPSes, or Uninterruptable Power Supplies, offer protection against brownouts or power loss, and usually have better power protection circuits as well.

#### Mini Rack UPSes

  - [Goal Zero Sherpa 100 AC](https://amzn.to/40tUb3r) (requires USB-C PD 60W+ input and rack shelf)
  - [Tripp Lite 600VA 300W UPS - BC600R](https://amzn.to/3WnvQdg) (fits within the bottom of a RackMate, see [this issue](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mini-rack/issues/1#issuecomment-2599063696))

Ongoing discussions:

  - [Find the perfect 1U 10" Mini Rack UPS](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mini-rack/issues/1)

#### Device-specific UPSes

  - [PiSugar 3 Plus 5000 mAh Pi model B UPS](https://amzn.to/4alpT6k) (rack mounting can be tricky, requires one per Raspberry Pi, only supplies 3A at 5V)
  - [Geekworm X1200 5V UPS HAT for Pi 5](https://www.amazon.com/Geekworm-X1200-Raspberry-Shutdown-Detection/dp/B0CRYVC8C5?ref_=ast_sto_dp) (rack mounting can be tricky)
  - [Waveshare UPS Module 3S for SBCs](https://amzn.to/3WgNajM) (rack mounting can be tricky)

### <a name="patch-panels"></a>Patch Panels

Patch panels help organize a mess of RJ45 network cables, USB, HDMI, Coax, or whatever other signals you'd like to pass through from the back to the front. Often mounted just above or below a switch for a tidy install.

  - [Rapink Patch Panel Mini 12 Port Cat6A Shielded Patch Panel](https://amzn.to/3PelLuR)

### <a name="network-gear"></a>Network Gear

The heart of every homelab is a network switch or router. There aren't a lot of switches that can natively mount in a 10" rack, but every year a couple new 'half rack' models are introduced.

In this section, gear will be split between devices which natively mount in a 10" rack (e.g. with hard-mounted rack ears), and devices which can _fit_ in a 10" rack but require a shelf or 3D printed mounting adapter.

Note: Some switches intended for full-width rack mount ears _may_ work in a 10" rack with 'universal' rack ears, like the [Pelopy Adjustable Universal Rack Mount Ear Kit](https://amzn.to/4gJ7BxT).

Some manufacturers require special kits for 10" rack compatibility:

  - Mikrotik offers the [RMK-2/10 kit](https://amzn.to/3Pmm5rT)) for full 10" compatibility
  - QNAP offers the [SP-EAR-QSWHALFRACK-01](https://store.qnap.com/sp-ear-qswhalfrack-01.html), though you may need to buy two kits to get a short ear for each side!
    - There's also a set of [3D Printable rack ears for QNAP 10" devices](https://www.printables.com/model/1023123-qnap-switch-10-rack-mount)
  - Pelopy offers a [Universal Rack Mount Ear Kit](https://amzn.to/4gJ7BxT) for many vendors—however fitment can be tricky...

See [Issue #2: Find a perfect way to mount small switches into mini racks](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mini-rack/issues/2) for more discussion around this topic.

  - Many 4, 5, 6, or 8 port cheap PoE/1 Gbps switches (too many to list...)
  
Note: Many of these switches have 3D printable ears on Printables, Thingiverse, etc.

### <a name="3d-printable-systems"></a>3D Printable mini rack systems

Some makers have created entire mini rack 'systems', where you 3D print a faceplate (or cut it out of metal, like with [SendCutSend](https://sendcutsend.com)), and insert different types of gear, like SBCs, SSDs, mini network switches, etc.

This section is for _systems_, not individual 3D printable parts. For parts like cable modem or mini switch mounts, please see the respective sections elsewhere.

### <a name="mini-pc-server-shelves"></a>Mini PC / Server Shelves

There are a variety of commercial options to mount Mini ITX motherboards (or SBC clusterboards, like the Turing Pi 2, or DeskPi Super6C!), or to mount Tiny/Mini/Micro PCs like a Lenovo M series computer.

  - [MyElectronics 10" 2U Mini ITX Short-Depth PC enclosure](https://amzn.to/41H6wCe)

### <a name="sbc-shelves"></a>SBC Shelves

SBCs, or Single Board Computers, are ideal for mini racks, due to their low power, thermal, and space requirements. You can often fit multiple SBCs per U of rack space, and there are many mini rack setups centered around an SBC cluster, or SBC routers or storage devices.

  - [Racknex UM-SBC shelves for Pi 2/3/4/5](https://racknex.com/shop/raspberry-pi/?filter_rack=10-inch)

### <a name="disk-shelves"></a>Disk Shelves

It can be difficult to adapt storage devices (especially full 3.5" hard drives!) into a mini rack, but there are always solutions—sometimes as simple as placing a 2-bay NAS on its side, or putting an entire 4-bay NAS on a shelf!

  - [GeeekPi / DeskPi RackMate SBC Shelf](https://amzn.to/49H76C6) (can hard-mount two 2.5" or 3.5" HDDs side by side)
  - [10" Rack Hard Drive Mount](https://www.printables.com/model/142325-10-rack-harddrive-mount) (can hard-mount two 3.5" drives)

### <a name="shelves-and-blanking-panels"></a>Shelves and Blanking Panels

Not all gear can be mounted on rack rails. And not every U of space needs to be filled. Often, a device needs extra room above or below for cooling or for an accessory that sticks out. In these cases, you can employ a rack shelf or blanking panels.

## <a name="cable-management"></a>Cable Management

Mini racks can quickly turn from beauty into beast, once you start plugging things into each other! Larger racks usually have areas where cables can be routed for a tidy finish and easy maintenance, but mini racks often don't have room. So you can add on accessories to tidy up unsightly cable messes.

I'm not the first person to build a mini rack. In fact, the mini-homelab community's been thriving for years! Check out [Reddit r/minilab](https://www.reddit.com/r/minilab/) for some extra inspiration.

If you would like your mini rack added to this list, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mini-rack/issues/new), add the `build showcase` label, and document your build! Once it is complete(ish), we can add it to this list:

There's a ton of things you can do in a Homelab—and many of them run perfectly fine on mini PCs or SBCs in a mini rack!

Here's a collection of cluster-related projects that may be a good test or starting point for your own rack, if you need the inspiration:

  - [Pi Cluster](https://github.com/geerlingguy/pi-cluster) - Build a K3s cluster with 3 or more SBCs
  - [Top500 Benchmark](https://github.com/geerlingguy/top500-benchmark) - Benchmark your cluster with HPL (High Performance Linpack)
