This site is maintained by [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com), who lives in the US. Sadly, mini rack gear is often only available in specific regions. For example, [many vendors sell only in the UK or parts of Europe](https://www.reddit.com/r/minilab/comments/1g1nto6/offtheshelf_10_gear_guide/). So this site is mainly focused on gear _I'm_ able to acquire, living in the US. That doesn't mean its scope can't broaden over time, though.

### <a name="racks"></a>10" Mini Racks

At the center of every mini rack is a 10" or 'half-width' rack. A typical rack is 19" wide, but half-racks fit in more places. There are only a few manufacturers of mini racks, currently, and availability varies by country.

### <a name="pdus"></a>PDUs (Power Distribution Units)

Every device in a rack needs power. If it's not provided by a PoE switch, it has to come from somewhere! A PDU, or Power Distribution Unit, takes one power source (usually AC wall power) and lets you plug multiple devices into it—whether through DC 12V adapters, USB-C, or AC outlets.

Some PDUs can be remotely managed, other PDUs are basically rack-mountable surge protectors. And yet others distribute power with more _panache_.

  - [GeeekPi DC PDU Lite - 7 Channel 12V 0.5U PDU](https://amzn.to/3DliKGG)
  - [PDUOnline (UK) 10" Rack PDUs](https://pduonline.co.uk/product-category/rack-pdus/10-horizontal-pdus/)

  - [AliExpress US Power Strip - 3 socket](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805777681738.html)

> **Note**: Some small PoE switches also have PoE+ or PoE++ power input, such as the [Ubiquiti USW-Ultra](https://store.ui.com/us/en/category/switching-utility/collections/pro-ultra/products/usw-ultra). Assuming you are in a location with another PoE++ switch, and everything is PoE-powered, you could power everything off one Ethernet cable, and bypass the need for a PDU or UPS in the mini rack!

### <a name="upses"></a>UPSes (Uninterruptible Power Supplies)

UPSes, or Uninterruptable Power Supplies, offer protection against brownouts or power loss, and usually have better power protection circuits as well.

#### Mini Rack UPSes

  - [Goal Zero Sherpa 100 AC](https://amzn.to/40tUb3r) (requires USB-C PD 60W+ input and rack shelf)

Ongoing discussions:

  - [Find the perfect 1U 10" Mini Rack UPS](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mini-rack/issues/1)

#### Device-specific UPSes

  - [PiSugar 3 Plus 5000 mAh Pi model B UPS](https://amzn.to/4alpT6k) (rack mounting can be tricky, requires one per Raspberry Pi, only supplies 3A at 5V)
  - [Geekworm X1200 5V UPS HAT for Pi 5](https://www.amazon.com/Geekworm-X1200-Raspberry-Shutdown-Detection/dp/B0CRYVC8C5?ref_=ast_sto_dp) (rack mounting can be tricky)
  - [Waveshare UPS Module 3S for SBCs](https://amzn.to/3WgNajM) (rack mounting can be tricky)

### <a name="patch-panels"></a>Patch Panels

Patch panels help organize a mess of RJ45 network cables, USB, HDMI, Coax, or whatever other signals you'd like to pass through from the back to the front. Often mounted just above or below a switch for a tidy install.

  - [Rapink Patch Panel Mini 12 Port Cat6A Shielded Patch Panel](https://amzn.to/3PelLuR)

### <a name="network-gear"></a>Network Gear

The heart of every homelab is a network switch or router. There aren't a lot of switches that can natively mount in a 10" rack, but every year a couple new 'half rack' models are introduced.

In this section, gear will be split between devices which natively mount in a 10" rack (e.g. with hard-mounted rack ears), and devices which can _fit_ in a 10" rack but require a shelf or 3D printed mounting adapter.

Note: Some switches intended for full-width rack mount ears _may_ work in a 10" rack with 'universal' rack ears, like the [Pelopy Adjustable Universal Rack Mount Ear Kit](https://amzn.to/4gJ7BxT).

Some manufacturers require special kits for 10" rack compatibility:

  - Mikrotik offers the [RMK-2/10 kit](https://amzn.to/3Pmm5rT)) for full 10" compatibility
  - QNAP offers the [SP-EAR-QSWHALFRACK-01](https://store.qnap.com/sp-ear-qswhalfrack-01.html), though you may need to buy two kits to get a short ear for each side!
    - There's also a set of [3D Printable rack ears for QNAP 10" devices](https://www.printables.com/model/1023123-qnap-switch-10-rack-mount)
  - Pelopy offers a [Universal Rack Mount Ear Kit](https://amzn.to/4gJ7BxT) for many vendors—however fitment can be tricky...

See [Issue #2: Find a perfect way to mount small switches into mini racks](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mini-rack/issues/2) for more discussion around this topic.

  - Many 4, 5, 6, or 8 port cheap PoE/1 Gbps switches (too many to list...)
  
Note: Many of these switches have 3D printable ears on Printables, Thingiverse, etc.

### <a name="3d-printable-systems"></a>3D Printable mini rack systems

Some makers have created entire mini rack 'systems', where you 3D print a faceplate (or cut it out of metal, like with [SendCutSend](https://sendcutsend.com)), and insert different types of gear, like SBCs, SSDs, mini network switches, etc.

This section is for _systems_, not individual 3D printable parts. For parts like cable modem or mini switch mounts, please see the respective sections elsewhere.

### <a name="mini-pc-server-shelves"></a>Mini PC / Server Shelves

There are a variety of commercial options to mount Mini ITX motherboards (or SBC clusterboards, like the Turing Pi 2, or DeskPi Super6C!), or to mount Tiny/Mini/Micro PCs like a Lenovo M series computer.

  - [MyElectronics 10" 2U Mini ITX Short-Depth PC enclosure](https://amzn.to/41H6wCe)

### <a name="sbc-shelves"></a>SBC Shelves

SBCs, or Single Board Computers, are ideal for mini racks, due to their low power, thermal, and space requirements. You can often fit multiple SBCs per U of rack space, and there are many mini rack setups centered around an SBC cluster, or SBC routers or storage devices.

  - [GeeekPi / DeskPi RackMate 2U Rack mount for Pi 5/4 with M.2 NVMe](https://amzn.to/4glDzjL)

### <a name="disk-shelves"></a>Disk Shelves

It can be difficult to adapt storage devices (especially full 3.5" hard drives!) into a mini rack, but there are always solutions—sometimes as simple as placing a 2-bay NAS on its side, or putting an entire 4-bay NAS on a shelf!

  - [GeeekPi / DeskPi RackMate SBC Shelf](https://amzn.to/49H76C6) (can hard-mount two 2.5" or 3.5" HDDs side by side)
  - [10" Rack Hard Drive Mount](https://www.printables.com/model/142325-10-rack-harddrive-mount) (can hard-mount two 3.5" drives)

### <a name="shelves-and-blanking-panels"></a>Shelves and Blanking Panels

Not all gear can be mounted on rack rails. And not every U of space needs to be filled. Often, a device needs extra room above or below for cooling or for an accessory that sticks out. In these cases, you can employ a rack shelf or blanking panels.

## <a name="cable-management"></a>Cable Management

Mini racks can quickly turn from beauty into beast, once you start plugging things into each other! Larger racks usually have areas where cables can be routed for a tidy finish and easy maintenance, but mini racks often don't have room. So you can add on accessories to tidy up unsightly cable messes.

There's a ton of things you can do in a Homelab—and many of them run perfectly fine on mini PCs or SBCs in a mini rack!

Here's a collection of cluster-related projects that may be a good test or starting point for your own rack, if you need the inspiration:
